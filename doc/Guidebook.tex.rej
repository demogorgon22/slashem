! Having exhausted your own meager financial resources, as well as those of
! your parents, you find that you must end your formal education.  Your lack of
! experience and skills leaves you facing a pretty grim future.  You could look
! for some sort of menial job and hope to perform well enough to be noticed and
! perhaps rise in responsibilities until you were earning enough money to be
! comfortable.  Or you could set out into the world and make your livelihood by
! prospecting, stealing, crusading, or just plain killing, for your gold.
! Over the objections of your local guildmaster, you opt to follow the
! adventuring route.  After all, when adventurers came back this way they
! usually seemed better off than when they passed through the first time.  And
! who was to say that all of those who did not return had not just kept going?
  %.pg
  
  Asking around, you hear about a bauble, called the Amulet of Yendor by some,
  which, if you can find it, will bring you great wealth.  One legend you were
  told even mentioned that the one who finds the amulet will be granted
  immortality by the gods.  The amulet is rumored to be somewhere beyond the
! Valley of Gehennom, deep within the Mazes of Menace.  You decide that even if
! the rumors of the amulet's powers are untrue, and even if it won't cure the
! common plague, you should at least be able to sell the tales of your
! adventures to the local minstrels for a tidy sum.  You spend one last night
! fortifying yourself at the local inn, becoming more and more depressed as you
! watch the odds of your success being posted on the inn's walls getting lower
! and lower.  In the morning you awake, gather together your belongings, and

! Recently, you have begun to find yourself unfulfilled and distant 
! in your daily occupation.  Strange dreams of prospecting, stealing, 
! crusading, and combat have haunted you in your sleep for many months, 
! but you aren't sure of the reason.  You wonder whether you have in 
! fact been having those dreams all your life, and somehow managed to 
! forget about them until now.  Some nights you awaken suddenly
! and cry out, terrified at the vivid recollection of the strange and 
! powerful creatures that seem to be lurking behind every corner of the 
! dungeon in your dream.  Could these details haunting your dreams be real?  
! As each night passes, you feel the desire to enter the mysterious caverns 
! near the ruins grow stronger.  Each morning, however, you quickly put 
! the idea out of your head as you recall the tales of those who entered 
! the caverns before you and did not return.  Eventually you can resist 
! the yearning to seek out the fantastic place in your dreams no longer.  
! After all, when other adventurers came back this way after spending time 
! in the caverns, they usually seemed better off than when they passed 
! through the first time.  And who was to say that all of those who did 
! not return had not just kept going?
