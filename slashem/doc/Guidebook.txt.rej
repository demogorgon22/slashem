            1.  Introduction
  
!                Having exhausted your own  meager  financial  resources,  as
!           well  as  those  of your parents, you find that you must end your
!           formal education.  Your lack of experience and skills leaves  you
!           facing a pretty grim future.  You could look for some sort of me-
!           nial job and hope to  perform  well  enough  to  be  noticed  and
!           perhaps  rise  in  responsibilities until you were earning enough
!           money to be comfortable.  Or you could set out into the world and
!           make your livelihood by prospecting, stealing, crusading, or just
!           plain killing, for your gold.  Over the objections of your  local
!           guildmaster, you opt to follow the adventuring route.  After all,
!           when adventurers came back this way they  usually  seemed  better
!           off than when they passed through the first time.  And who was to
!           say that all of those who did not return had not just kept going?
  
                 Asking around, you hear about a bauble, called the Amulet of
            Yendor  by  some, which, if you can find it, will bring you great
            wealth.  One legend you were told even mentioned that the one who
            finds  the  amulet  will be granted immortality by the gods.  The
            amulet is rumored to be somewhere beyond the Valley of  Gehennom,
!           deep within the Mazes of Menace.  You decide that even if the ru-
!           mors of the amulet's powers are untrue, and even if it won't cure
!           the  common plague, you should at least be able to sell the tales
!           of your adventures to the local minstrels for a  tidy  sum.   You
!           spend one last night fortifying yourself at the local inn, becom-
!           ing more and more depressed as you watch the odds of your success
!           being  posted on the inn's walls getting lower and lower.  In the
!           morning you awake, gather together your belongings, and  set  off
!           on your adventure...

-                Archeologists understand dungeons pretty well; this  enables

            1.  Introduction
  
!           Recently, you have begun to find yourself unfulfilled and distant
!           in  your daily occupation.  Strange dreams of prospecting, steal-
!           ing, crusading, and combat have haunted you  in  your  sleep  for
!           many  months,  but  you  aren't  sure  of the reason.  You wonder
!           whether you have in fact been having those dreams all your  life,
!           and  somehow managed to forget about them until now.  Some nights
!           you awaken suddenly and cry out, terrified at the vivid recollec-
!           tion  of the strange and powerful creatures that seem to be lurk-
!           ing behind every corner of the  dungeon  in  your  dream.   Could
!           these details haunting your dreams be real? As each night passes,
!           you feel the desire to enter  the  mysterious  caverns  near  the
!           ruins  grow stronger.  Each morning, however, you quickly put the
!           idea out of your head as you recall the tales of  those  who  en-
!           tered  the caverns before you and did not return.  Eventually you
!           can resist the yearning to seek out the fantastic place  in  your
!           dreams  no  longer.  After  all, when other adventurers came back
!           this way after spending time in the caverns, they usually  seemed
!           better off than when they passed through the first time.  And who
!           was to say that all of those who did not return had not just kept
!           going?

                 Asking around, you hear about a bauble, called the Amulet of
            Yendor  by  some, which, if you can find it, will bring you great
            wealth.  One legend you were told even mentioned that the one who
            finds  the  amulet  will be granted immortality by the gods.  The
            amulet is rumored to be somewhere beyond the Valley of  Gehennom,
!           deep  within  the Mazes of Menace.  Upon hearing the legends, you
!           immediately realize that there is some profound and  undiscovered
!           reason that you are to descend into the caverns and seek out that
!           amulet of which they spoke.  Even if the rumors of  the  amulet's
!           powers are untrue, you decide that you should at least be able to
!           sell the tales of your adventures to the local  minstrels  for  a
!           tidy  sum,  especially if you encounter any of the terrifying and
!           magical creatures of your dreams along the way.   You  spend  one
!           last  night  fortifying  yourself at the local inn, becoming more
!           and more depressed as you watch the odds of  your  success  being

!           8.  Conduct
! 
!                As if winning NetHack were  not  difficult  enough,  certain
!           players  seek to challenge themselves by imposing restrictions on
!           the way they play the game.  The game automatically  tracks  some
!           of  these  challenges,  which can be checked at any time with the
!           #conduct command or at the end of the game.  When you perform  an
!           action  which  breaks  a  challenge, it will no longer be listed.
!           This gives players extra ``bragging rights'' for winning the game
!           with  these  challenges.  Note that it is perfectly acceptable to
!           win the game without resorting to these restrictions and that  it
!           is  unusual  for  players  to adhere to challenges the first time
!           they win the game.
! 
!                Several of the challenges are related  to  eating  behavior.
!           The  most difficult of these is the foodless challenge.  Although
!           creatures can survive long periods of time without food, there is
!           a  physiological  need for water; thus there is no restriction on
!           drinking beverages, even if they provide some  minor  food  bene-
!           fits.   Calling  upon  your god for help with starvation does not
!           violate any food challenges either.
! 
!                A strict vegan diet is one which  avoids  any  food  derived
!           from  animals.   The  primary  source  of nutrition is fruits and
!           vegetables.  The corpses and tins of blobs (`b'), jellies  (`j'),
!           and fungi (`F') are also considered to be vegetable matter.  Cer-
!           tain human food is prepared without animal products; namely, lem-
!           bas  wafers, cram rations, food rations (gunyoki), K-rations, and
!           C-rations.  Metal or another normally indigestible material eaten
!           while polymorphed into a creature that can digest it is also con-
!           sidered vegan food.  Note however that eating  such  items  still
!           counts against foodless conduct.
! 
!                Vegetarians do not  eat  animals;  however,  they  are  less
!           selective  about  eating animal byproducts than vegans.  In addi-
!           tion to the vegan items listed above, they may eat  any  kind  of
!           pudding  (`P')  other than the black puddings, eggs and food made
!           from eggs (fortune cookies and pancakes),  food  made  with  milk
!           (cream pies and candy bars), and lumps of royal jelly.  Monks are
!           expected to observe a vegetarian diet.
! 
!                Eating any kind of meat violates the vegetarian, vegan,  and
!           foodless  conducts.   This includes tripe rations, the corpses or
!

!           tins of any monsters not mentioned above, and the  various  other
!           chunks  of meat found in the dungeon.  Swallowing and digesting a
!           monster while polymorphed is treated as if you ate the creature's
!           corpse.   Eating  leather,  dragon  hide, or bone items while po-
!           lymorphed into a creature that can digest it, or  eating  monster
!           brains  while  polymorphed  into  a (master) mind flayer, is con-
!           sidered eating an animal, although wax is only an  animal  bypro-
!           duct.
! 
!                Regardless of conduct, there will be some  items  which  are
!           indigestible,  and  others  which  are hazardous to eat.  Using a
!           swallow-and-digest attack against a monster is equivalent to eat-
!           ing the monster's corpse.  Please note that the term ``vegan'' is
!           used here only in the context of diet.  You  are  still  free  to
!           choose not to use or wear items derived from animals (e.g. leath-
!           er, dragon hide, bone, horns, coral), but the game will not  keep
!           track of this for you.  Also note that ``milky'' potions may be a
!           translucent white, but they do not contain milk, so they are com-
!           patible  with  a  vegan  diet.   Slime  molds  or  player-defined
!           ``fruits'', although they could be anything from ``cherries''  to
!           ``pork chops'', are also assumed to be vegan.
! 
!                An atheist is one who rejects religion.  This means that you
!           cannot  #pray,  #offer  sacrifices  to  any god, #turn undead, or
!           #chat with a priest.  Particularly selective  readers  may  argue
!           that  playing  Monk or Priest characters should violate this con-
!           duct; that is a choice left to the player.  Offering  the  Amulet
!           of  Yendor  to  your  god is necessary to win the game and is not
!           counted against this conduct.  You are also not penalized for be-
!           ing  spoken  to  by an angry god, priest(ess), or other religious
!           figure; a true atheist would hear the words but attach no special
!           meaning to them.
! 
!                Most players fight with a wielded weapon (or  tool  intended
!           to be wielded as a weapon).  Another challenge is to win the game
!           without using such a wielded weapon.  You are still permitted  to
!           throw,  fire,  and kick weapons; use a wand, spell, or other type
!           of item; or fight with your hands and feet.
! 
!                In NetHack, a pacifist refuses to cause  the  death  of  any
!           other  monster  (i.e. if you would get experience for the death).
!           This is a particularly difficult challenge, although it is  still
!           possible to gain experience by other means.
! 
!                An illiterate character cannot read or write.  This includes
!           reading  a scroll, spellbook, fortune cookie message, or t-shirt;
!           writing a scroll; or making an engraving of anything other than a
!           single ``x'' (the traditional signature of an illiterate person).
!           Reading an engraving, or any item that is absolutely necessary to
!           win  the game, is not counted against this conduct.  The identity
!           of scrolls and spellbooks  (and  knowledge  of  spells)  in  your
!           starting  inventory  is  assumed to be learned from your teachers
!           prior to the start of the game and isn't counted.

!                There are several other minor challenges.  It is possible to

!           any  object into another object of the same type (``polypiling'')
!           or the form of your own body into another creature (``polyself'')
!           by  wand,  spell,  or potion of polymorph; avoiding these effects
!           are each considered challenges.  Finally, you may  sometimes  re-
!           ceive  wishes; a game without an attempt to wish for an object is
!           a challenge, as is a game without wishing for an  artifact  (even
