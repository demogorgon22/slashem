              which may be able to restore a save file from the level files.
!             Old bones files and saved games.
  
  === Resuming a saved game
      Double-click (or open) the desired saved game file or open NetHack
!         and answer the "Who are you?" dialog with the player name of
!         the saved game in the Dungeon Folder.
  
  === Windows
      The Dungeon Map and Message windows are the essential windows used
!         during window-mode play.  During tty-mode play there is only one
!         window which displays the map, messages, lists and other info.
!         For window-mode play, lists (e.g. the list of objects that may
!         be wielded) and special info windows appear as needed.  Windows
!         may be closed in the normal ways (i.e. clicking their close box,
!         choosing 'Close' from the File menu or typing the command
!         equivalent for 'Close', cmd-W) and the list windows may also be
!         dismissed by hitting the space bar (or Return or Enter Keys).
!         Hitting the ESCape key will dismiss special windows without
!         scrolling to the end.
  
      The command "Reposition" on the File menu may be used to restore the
!         the startup sizes and locations of the various windows.  The
!         window positions are saved in a file labelled "NetHack Windows"
!         in the appropriate preferences folder.
  
  === Default options
      The following options are specific to the Macintosh port:
      MACgraphics  - use enhanced dungeon map symbols [TRUE]
      large_font   - use 12 point font instead of 9 point font [FALSE]
      popup_dialog - use real dialogs for question prompts [FALSE]
      page_wait    - display  --MORE--  after messages [TRUE]
  
      large_font is currently a pre-game option and has no effect
!         after the Dungeon Map window is created.
  
      Default options may be set by editing the NetHack Defaults text
!         file (possibly using SimpleText or your favorite editor).
!         Unix(tm)-style notation is used, as in:
!     OPTIONS=name:Arnold,time,!tombstone
  
      It should also be mentioned here that there are two graphic
      interface modes available: 'mac' and 'tty'.  Choosing between
