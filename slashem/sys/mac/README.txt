This is the binary distribution of Slash'EM 0.0.6e4f2mac0.   This is a PowerPC binary, so it will run only on a PowerPC machine.  Please contact me, Paul Hurtley (hurtley@acm.org), if you would like to run Slash'EM on an older Macintosh with a 68K processor.

This package is freely distributable; see the file 'license' for details.

Read the Guidebook for a general description of what Slash'EM is and how to play.  Unfortunately, the Guidebook is > 32K, so you will need something other than SimpleText to view it.  Edit the file Slash'EM Defaults in this directory to modify startup options.  Feel free to turn off News when you get tired of seeing its message when you start up.
