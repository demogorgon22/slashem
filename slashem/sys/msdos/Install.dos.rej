      We have provided the proper makefiles for building NetHack using the
      following compilers:
! 
!     Microsoft C 7.0 and Microsoft Visual C++ Professional (MSVC) 1.0 or later
!     djgpp V2.0 or later
  
      For specific details concerning each compiler, please see the
      corresponding appendix.
  
!     The makefile named Makefile.MSC is for use with NMAKE, the make
!     utility that ships with the Microsoft C Compiler version 7.0 and
!     above, including Microsoft Visual C++ Professional.
  
      The makefile named Makefile.GCC is for use with GNU Make that
      accompanies djgpp.

      If you elected to add graphical tile support, set TILESUPPORT to Y.
  
      Set USE_DLB to Y if you wish to place NetHack's many runtime files into
      a special archive that NetHack can utilize.  This is highly recommended!

      If you changed your build settings to include TERMCAP support, copy
      termcap to your game directory.  
  
-     Edit defaults.nh to reflect your particular setup and personal 
-     preferences, by following the comments.
- 
      Also, make sure the file msdoshlp.txt made it to your game directory.
      If it didn't, move it from sys\msdos to your game directory
      yourself.

      The Microsoft Visual C++ Professional compiler utilizes the same
      Makefiles and instructions for compiling as Microsoft C version 7.0.
  
! Appendix C - DJGPP Compiler (gcc ported to msdos)
  
      If you have a 386 or better machine, you are in luck.  You can compile
      NetHack without spending money on a compiler.  DJGPP is available free
      from many archive sites.
