Installing Slash'EM with a Qt or KDE interface
----------------------------------------------

This document describes the installation of Slash'EM with a Qt interface
on X11.  The Qt interface is an alternative to the Athena-widgets interface
found in ../win/X11.  You can download Qt for UNIX from http://www.troll.no.
You need Qt 2.0 or later to use this code.

There are no explicit UNIX dependencies in this code, but we only regularly
test it under UNIX.  If you have Qt for Windows, that should also work.

To use this code:

   1. follow the directions for the UNIX installation (in ../sys/unix)
      to create the Makefiles.

   2. ../../include/config.h

        define QT_GRAPHICS (search for it).  You can comment out
        TTY_GRAPHICS if you want to, or leave it in to support both
        interfaces (in which case be sure you have the right curses
        libraries etc. required for that interface).

	You may define X11_GRAPHICS and/or GTK_GRAPHICS in addition to
	support multiple windowing ports (and tty as well, if you want)
	in the same executable if you so desire.

   3. ../../src/Makefile

        add $(WINQTSRC), $(WINQTOBJ), and $(WINQTLIB) to WINSRC, WINOBJ,
        and WINLIB respectively, and compile.  This will give you an
        executable supporting both Qt and tty windowing.  Prepend
        -L$(QTDIR)/lib to LFLAGS.

	As part of your Qt installation, you should have an environment
	variable QTDIR defined which src/Makefile uses to find the
	Qt libraries and support files. If you don't have such a
	variable defined, then you can define QTDIR in src/Makefile to
	the appropriate place. You can also change the definitions of
	QTLIBDIR etc. if your installation is particularly unusual.

	To support multiple windowing ports, change the definitions
	of WINSRC, WINOBJ and WINLIB to include all the relevant
	variables.

   4. ../../Makefile (the top-level makefile)

        change the CNF_SHARE_QTND setting to contain the files "x11tiles"
        and "rip.xpm" and the CNF_SHARE_DATND to include $(CNF_SHARE_QTND).

	If you want to support the other windowing ports, include
	their $(CNF_SHARE_XXXND) variables also.

   5. Follow all the instructions in ../../sys/unix/Install.unx for
      the remainder of the installation process.

   6. Consider adding the lines below to your .slashemrc (or equivalent
      if you don't run UNIX), as they are likely to give the best interface
      for this window port:

        OPTIONS=name:player,number_pad,menustyle:partial,!time,showexp
        OPTIONS=hilite_pet,toptenwin,msghistory:200

      The Qt port has support for three extra variables which can also be
      specified. These are:

	   qt_tilewidth    The width of each tile in pixels
	   qt_tileheight   The height of each tile in pixels
	   qt_fontsize	   The font size. One of huge, large, medium or small.
	   		   These can be abreviated to h, l, m or s.


If you are using KDE, you may want to also try the KDE version. It just
uses the KDE menubar and follows other KDE conventions - there is no
extra functionality. To do so, first ensure that you have KDE 2.x
libraries on your system (in 1999 KDE 1.x was the norm); then, add
$(KDECXXFLAGS) to the CXXFLAGS definition, $(KDELFLAGS) to the LFLAGS
definition and $(WINKDELIB) to WINLIB.  Some additional files here -
kse-mini.xpm, kse.xpm, and kslashem.lnk are useful if you want to
install "kslashem" in the KDE games directory.
