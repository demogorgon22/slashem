MILITARY FORK

The lowly hay fork was straightened and strengthened to provide a very potent weapon, the military fork. This pole arm had two efficient piercing points, for holding off an enemy, and sometimes a shorter third tine in the crotch of the fork, so that opponents were channeled into a third attack. The major drawback to this pole arm was its lack of effective penetrating power with respect to heavily armored targets. The fork principle was soon combined with other pole arms to form very efficient tools of war. 

BILL HOOK

The English bill hook is almost exactly the same as the French guisarme, but its concave edge is the sharp one, and rather than a straight back spike it typically has an L-shaped tine projecting forward. This arrangement is slightly more effective than the European guisarme in terms of parrying, but requires great skill to master. 

bardiche
    This very broad and heavy axe links the pole axes to the pole cleavers 
    as a sort of transitional step between the two forms, although its only 
    obvious use is as a military arm. A bardiche head ranges from about 
    2 feet to over 3 feet in length, and is attached to its haft with rings.
