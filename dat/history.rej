- In addition to the merged features, a number of other notable modifications
- were made to the game:
- 
- The character's race was split from his/her/its role in life.  Although

- 
- Two new classes, or "roles", the Monk and Ranger have been added. As a result
- of the Elf being split off as a race, the Elf class was removed from the game.
