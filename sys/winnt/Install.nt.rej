!         Microsoft Visual C++ V6.0 SP3
  
      The Makefile was created for use with MS NMAKE which is provided with 
      the Microsoft compiler.

      Defaults.nh, NetHack.exe, nhdat, record, and recover.exe

!     Defaults.nh is distributed as sys/winnt/winnt.cnf, but

      Edit Defaults.nh to reflect your particular setup and personal

!     defaults to the same directory as that where the NetHack.exe executable
!     resides.  You only need to set HACKDIR in Defaults.nh if, 
      for some reason, you wish to override that.
