! NOTE: As NetHack 3.3, you must turn off OLDROUTINENAMES -- so you can't use

  preferences or insert another precompiled header that has this define off.

+ Creating projects for NetHack with MetroWerks IDE 3.3 (Pro 4)
  
+ This is what I changed from the default settings when creating a 68K version.  Some of
+ the settings may not be necessary.  For example, NetHack doesn't use floating point,
+ so I didn't have to check 8 byte doubles.  Some are interrelated.  For example, the
+ codegen and the Math and MSL libraries used.
+ 
+ For MakeDefs.u, DgnComp.u, LevComp.u: 
+ 1. Select File>>New Project...>>MacOS>>C_C++>>Standard Console>>Std C Console 68K
+ 2. 68K Settings:
+ 	Target Settings:
+ 		+ Set "Target Name" to {MakeDefs,DgnComp,LevComp}.
+ 	68K Target:
+ 		+ Set "File Name" to {MakeDefs,DgnComp,LevComp}.
+ 	C/C++ Language:
+ 		+ Check Require Function Prototypes, uncheck everything else.
+ 		+ Clear "Prefix File".
+ 	68K Processor:
+ 		+ Set "Code Model" to Large.
+ 		+ Check 68020 Codegen, 4-Byte Ints, 8-Byte Doubles, Far Data, Far Method Tables,
+ 			Far String Constants.  Uncheck everything else.
+ 3. Libraries 68K
+ 	+ Remove the C++ Library (it is not needed).
+ 	+ Change math library to MathLib68K Fa(4i_8d).Lib.
+ 	+ Change MSL C library to MSL C.68K Fa(4i_8d).Lib.
+ 	Note: The actual libraries used must match the CodeGen options in 68K Processor.
+ 
+ 
+ For NetHack.u:
+ 1. Select File>>New Project...>>MacOS>>C_C++>>MacOS ToolBox>>MacOS ToolBox 68K
+ 2. 68K Settings
+ 	Target Settings:
+ 		+ Set "Target Name" to NetHack Debug and NetHack Final.
+ 	68K Target:
+ 		+ Set "File Name" to NetHack Debug and NetHack Final.
+ 		+ Set "Creator" to 'nh31'.
+ 		+ Set "Preferred Heap Size (k)" to 2500.
+ 		+ Set "Minimum Heap Size (k)" to 1500.
+ 	C/C++ Language:
+ 		+ Check Require Function Prototypes, uncheck everything else.
+ 		+ Set "Prefix File" to LocalDefines.h.  I use this header to define
+ 		  OLDROUTINENAMES because the pre-compiled header doesn't have it set
+ 		  any more.  One of these days we'll fix up the code...
+ 	68K Processor:
+ 		+ Set "Code Model" to Large.
+ 		+ Check 68020 Codegen, 4-Byte Ints, 8-Byte Doubles, Far Data, Far Method Tables,
+ 			Far String Constants.  Uncheck everything else.
+ 3. Libraries 68K
+ 	+ Remove the C++ Library (it is not needed).

+ 	+ Change MSL C library to MSL C.68K Fa(4i_8d).Lib.

+ 	
+ 
+ For Recover.u:
+ 1. Select File>>New Project...>>MacOS>>C_C++>>MacOS ToolBox>>MacOS ToolBox 68K
+ 2. 68K Settings
+ 	Target Settings:
+ 		+ Set "Target Name" to Recover Debug and Recover Final.
+ 	68K Target:
+ 		+ Set "File Name" to Recover Debug and Recover Final.
+ 		+ Set "Creator" to 'nhRc'.
+ 	C/C++ Language:
+ 		+ Check Require Function Prototypes, uncheck everything else.
+ 		+ Set "Prefix File" to LocalDefines.h.  I use this header to define
+ 		  OLDROUTINENAMES because the pre-compiled header doesn't have it set
