  Notes:
  
  1.  Save files and bones files from earlier versions will not work with
!     3.3.0.  The scoreboard file (RECORD) from versions 3.2.x is slightly
!     different format but should be compatible.
  
  2.  To specify user-preference options in your environment, define the
      logical name NETHACKOPTIONS to have the value of a quoted string

      tradeoff for enabling checkpoint is that using it makes level changes
      do more I/O and take longer.  The "menustyle" option controls some
      aspects of the user interface, and can be set to "menustyle:traditional"
!     to make 3.3.0 or 3.2.x behave more like 3.1.3.
  
      If logical name or DCL symbol NETHACKOPTIONS is not defined, NetHack
      will try HACKOPTIONS instead.  Regardless of whether or not either
